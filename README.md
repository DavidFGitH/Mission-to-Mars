Mission to Mars with Web Scraping

## Overview of Project

To create a web application that scrapes data off different websites related to Mars and presenting them in a consolidated usuable manner.

### Notes

I made sure to make all my columns col-md-4 to make it mobile friendly, and I added bootstrap elements to emphasize the new portion of the scraping data button as well as block-quoting the description portion of the Mars News to make it more distinct from the title.
